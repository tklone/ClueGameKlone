Taylor Klone, Section C
No outside help used other than office hours with Baldwin & help in class from Kelly!

"Come to me all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
--Matthew 11:28-30
